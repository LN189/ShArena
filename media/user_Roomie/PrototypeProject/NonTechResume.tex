\vspace{-19pt}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep = -0.75 mm, leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Mini-Language Parser} \hfill{\sl \small Spring 2017}\\
Developed a parser for a minor self-defined language with given grammar which parses a valid code into
a \textbf{parsed tree}, implemented in the Racket Programming Language.
\item \textbf{Particle Motion Simulator} \hfill{\sl \small Spring 2017}\\
Implemented a simulator for motion of particles under mutual gravitational forces in two dimensions
coded using trees in the Racket Programming Language
\item \textbf{XLR8}\hfill{\sl \small Autumn 2016}\\
Built an app-controlled bot capable of negotiating different kinds of obstacles in its path. Integrated a Bluetooth module with an IC to enable wireless control for the motors
\item \textbf{Animator}\hfill{\sl \small Autumn 2017}\\
Developed an application to take an image(independant of its resolution) as input(using a console) to generate a nice animation out of it, implemented in \textbf{Processing Language}
