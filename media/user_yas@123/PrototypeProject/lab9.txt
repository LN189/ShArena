Javascript and PHP
==============================================================


-----------------------------------------------------------
Submission Guidelines for assignment - (5 marks, 0 to be awarded in case these are not followed)[to be followed for both inlab and outlab]
-----------------------------------------------------------

For this lab (specifically for PHP), you will have to use your Mars Server (CSE logins) accounts.


Use:


ssh -X @mars.cse.iitb.ac.in

To login to your CSE account. Follow these instructions to create folder structure and build solutions:

1. Create a file readme.txt in lab#_rollno.1_rollno.2_rollno.3_rollno.4 directory, which contains contribution of each team member and references (cite where you get code/code snippets from).
e.g.lab3_154054002_154054005_154054001

2. Rename the directory lab#_rollno.1_rollno.2_rollno.3_rollno.4 to actual lab number instead of #, replace the rollno.N with your respective roll numbers.
e.g.lab3_154054002_154054005_154054001

3. Compress the directory to .tar.gz
e.g. codekars.tar.gx

4. Upload on Moodle. Submit one assignment per team.

Please note that for all the problems we may try invalid inputs as test cases, and you are supposed to think and evaluate your assigments for them before you submit.

Inlab

Q1) Write a javascript interactive program embedded inside an html page which tests if a given number is a palindrome number. The number can be input using a form.

Let the page be a little colorful (very subjective, don't ask doubts about it please, just do what you want.)

Q1a) Add a javascript runtime code error handler to a copy of the above program, Make an error in this copy of the program and show that it really works (i.e., an error message is popped up due to a bug in javascript program).

Let the error be shown using alert popup. You must use this functionality of error catching in all your programs below so that it helps you.

Q2) Javascript program asks for number N, then it creates a form with N blank cells to read N numbers. The program sorts the numbers input by the user and displays them  in the same page. Use sort function available in javascript... no need to write your own.

Q3) Write a javascript program which toggles an image when the mouse enters the image area and when it leaves after entering. You can select your set of images.



PHP

Q4) Word Frequency Counter

- Take a text file as input using file input in HTML on index.php

- Validate that the taken input file is with extension .txt using simple javascript. 
If not, pop an alert message
    
- In PHP, check that (file size < 100kB). If not, display error

- The text file has to be processed to produce the frequency count of
 (number of occurrences) of each word sorted in alphabetical order as a HTML table

- Frequency count must be case-insensitive
(e.g. both 'Hey' and 'hey' would be counted under the same word 'hey')


Q5) Write a PHP program to sort a list of elements using Gnome sort.
Gnome sort always finds the first place where two adjacent elements are in the wrong order and swaps them.
